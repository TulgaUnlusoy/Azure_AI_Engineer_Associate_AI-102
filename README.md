Azure AI Engineer Associate (AI-102) Notes - September 2025



## 1. Plan and Prepare to Develop AI Solutions on Azure
What are the differences between Azure AI Service and Azure Foundry
- Azure AI Services is
  - an Azure resource that provides a set of AI services from a single endpoint
    - Azure OpenAI
    - Azure AI Vision
    - Azure AI Search
    - Azure AI Language
    - Azure AI Foundry Content Safety
    - Azure AI Translator
    - Azure AI Face
    - Azure AI Custom Vision
    - Azure AI Document Intelligence
    - Azure AI Content Understanding
    - Azure AI Search
- Azure AI Foundry is
  - an Azure resource and a platform that allows you to create simple chat app that uses a generative AI model
    - Azure OpenAI
    - Azure AI Vision
    - Azure AI Speech
    - Azure AI Language
    - Azure AI Foundry Content Safety
    - Azure AI Translator
    - Azure AI Face
    - Azure AI Document Intelligence
    - Azure AI Content Understanding
  - allows
    - Project Organization
    - Resource Management
    - AI Development
    - Centralize Access Control
    - Centralize Cost Management
  - enables you to connect to resources in a project via Azure AI Foundry SDK

In most medium to large-scale development scenarios it's better to provision Azure AI services resources as part of an Azure AI Foundry project - enabling you to centralize control and cost management, and making it easier to manage shared resources and build the next generation of generative AI apps and agents.

## 2. Choose and Deploy Models from the Model Catalog in Azure AI Foundry portal
